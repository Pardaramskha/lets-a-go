# Let's-a-go
A first attempt at golang.

Don't look at the root folder, this is lame-ass one-nighter training.

* `/api-2` contains the API itself
* `/client` contains a vanilla CRA typescript client

## Improvement ideas
- [ ] learn how to `time` and `date`
- [ ] learn how to JWT
- [ ] learn how to manage files
- [ ] create filtering endpoints
- [ ] improve interfaces and type clarity
- [ ] improve error handling (remove panicking and fatalism)
- [ ] improve response errors in order to make any frontend love me
- [ ] (DX) add dependency to auto-refresh server on dev change
